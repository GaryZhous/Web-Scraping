# Web-Scraping
use of requests and beautiful soup
This repos focuses on the use of request and beautifulsoup libraries for web-scraping (getting the html code of a website and analyze it to find what we want).
Also, csv file is used to store scraped data. csv file is more useful here than txt file since it can store data in a table similar to Microsoft Excel.
